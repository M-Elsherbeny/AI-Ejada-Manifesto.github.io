## ðŸŽ¯ About

**This is our playbook.** 

An AI engineer working for the Ejada Team:
* Has responsibilities to their team â€“ **mentor, coach, and lead.**
* Knows their **playbook**. Follows their playbook. Fixes their playbook if it is broken. If they find a better playbook, they copy it. If somebody could use their playbook, they share it.
* **Leads by example.** Models the behaviors we desire both interpersonally and technically.
* Strives to understand how their work fits into a broader context and ensures the outcome.

The **AI Ejada Playbook** is our complete framework designed to guide AI engineers through the complexities of AI/ML software development. Unlike traditional SDLC methodologies, this framework addresses the unique challenges of probabilistic systems, data-driven development, and ethical AI implementation.
